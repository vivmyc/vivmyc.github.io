####Running the Test Suites
Navigate to http://vivmyc.github.io/P6

####Description
The bottom part of the screen will display the results from the automated tests suites using
the Jasmine Testing Framework.

All test specifications are in the file ./jasmine/spec/feedreader.js
These test suites verify the underlying business logic of the application as well as event
handling and DOM manipulation.

Using test-driven development, additional test cases for a new search feature have been
developed to test this new feature once it is added, as well as ensure that existing features
still function correctly.

####Test Suites Included:

- RSS Feeds
- The Menu
- Initial Entries
- New Feed Selection
- Search Functionality (Remove x on xdescribe to run this test suite)

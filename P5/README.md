## Project P5 - Neighborhood Map

### Running the application:

Navigate to http://vivmyc.github.io/P5

Here you can view various restaurants in the East Hampton NY area marked on a map.
Clicking on a map marker will pop up a window displaying the restaurant's address,
phone number and price category information obtained asynchronously from Foursquare.
You can click the phone link in the info window to call the restaurant.

The same information is available by clicking on a restaurant in the list below the map.
You can also filter and search for a particular restaurant using the search box provided.
Results of the search filter as you type, will be reflected in the list as well as the
map markers.

For your reference, the rental property you are staying at will be displayed on the map
as a home icon.

Please enjoy your stay!

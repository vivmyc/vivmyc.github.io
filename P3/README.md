===============================

Navigate to index.html from the browser to start the game.
You are the player at the center bottom of the screen on
the grass.
Your goal is to get to the water at the top of the screen
without running into any bugs.
Use the up, down, left and right arrows on the keyboard
to navigate.
Each time you successfully get to the water the running score
will be incremented and the player is reset to the starting
position.  Likewise, anytime a bug runs into the player, the
running score is decremented and the player is also reset to
the starting position.

Enhancements:
-The running score will be displayed at the bottom of the
 screen.
-Sounds will be played at the start of the game and every time
 a point is added or deducted from the score.


Hit refresh on the browser to reset the running score.

Have Fun!
